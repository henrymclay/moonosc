# Welcome to Moonosc
###### Version 0.1

Moonosc is a microservice written in Node that provides the current lunar phase as an HTTP response via a RESTful API. 
Moonosc is designed to do one thing: answer the question: "what is the lunar phase today?" 

#### Modes
With that in mind, there are two operating modes for Moonosc v0.1 

###### Mode 1
The first mode relays the relevant information (current lunar phase) from the US Naval Observatory's astronomy data API. This mode is accessible via a GET request to the root URI. If you are running locally via the 'npm start' command, you can view it at "localhost:PORT" through your browser, or via a curl to "localhost:PORT" from a terminal window. 

###### Mode 2 
The second mode calculates the current lunar phase based on the last known full moon. The repository includes a hardcoded starting date for this calculation, and will update it as it detects newer full moons. Right now this is handled via local file. This mode is accessible via a POST request to the root URI, and calculates based on the user's current date and time info. If you are running locally via 'npm start', then a curl POST command to localhost:PORT will show the response. Currently this provides more accurate data than Mode 1, likely due to 3rd party API constraints. 

#### Running Moonosc
Moonosc can be run from it's diretory with `npm start`. 
It will open on localhost:3001 unless a PORT variable is supplied in a .env file 
Moonosc is ready for deployment on platforms that host node apps, and is currently running at `moonosc.onrender.com`
